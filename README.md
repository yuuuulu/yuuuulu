- 😄 Correcting one's mindset and learning methods from high school is a key focus in college. It's necessary to make changes and seek a better version of oneself. At the same time, it's important to find one's strengths and interests, and ideally, align them with the times. Once a goal is set, one should commit fully.
- On the bright side, there are quite a few advantages to studying at XJTLU: The required courses are relatively few, and it's easy to arrange one's study time freely—what to do with this time is most useful—reading books, especially those one likes, is a good choice. There's no need to spend so much time competing for GPA—how to balance energy? The goal is not to use the least effort to get the most advantageous things for oneself, but to learn a little more of what one is interested in and useful during the continuous effort—what is useful? For example, I might be more interested in math than in programming, but I have to use programming to implement theories, so I need to be familiar with programming. However, the most important thing in college, I feel, is still the "people." Similarly, chatting is the most efficient learning method.
-  现代人太关注“快速逆袭”，却忘了真正的蜕变需要与岁月同步💪。
-  q: how to commit everyday with perseverance?
-  a：Think that: if you do not keep recording, you will learn nothing in your brain since when 2 years later, you will remenber nothing.
